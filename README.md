# CONTENT-BASED-IMAGE-RETRIEVAL (CBIR) with SCALABLE COLOR DESCRIPTOR (SCD)
===================================================
## 1. INTRODUCTION.
The objective of this repository is to make and show a sistem that allows the recovery and identification of similar images to a query image. All of this, without using manual anotations which are expensive and slow. To do this we will use the Scalable Color Descriptor from the MPEG7 - Colors Descriptors owing to color is an important visual attribute for both human vision and computer processing. 

The Scalable Color Descriptor (SCD) can be interpreted as a Haar transform–based encoding scheme applied across values of a color histogram in the HSV color space. The histogram values are extracted, normalized and nonlinearly mapped into a four-bit integer representation, giving higher signiﬁcance to small values. The Haar transform is applied to the four-bit integer values across the histogram bins. The basic unit of the transform consists of a sum operation and a difference operation which relate to primitive low-pass and high-pass ﬁlters.
